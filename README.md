## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- SCSS

### What I learned

This exercise was pretty easy for the most part. I have to learn about adding a color hue overlay to an image which I had never done before. I used a couple different solutions but found that the solution I used seemed the most efficient and simple.

### Continued development

In this excercise I mostly used flexbox for everything and grid just to center the card. I want to continue learning grid layouts since they seem beneficial for responsive layouts.
